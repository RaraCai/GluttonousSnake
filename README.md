# Gluttonous Snake Game
`notice`This is one of Course Projects of my OOP course at school.  
It's welcome to exchange and discuss ideas but pay attention that `plagiarism` is NOT advocated if you are also learning the OOP course.
## File Schema
`Record.cpp`&`Record.h` 
`item.cpp`&`item.h` 
`manager.cpp`&`Record.h` 
`myGUI.cpp`&`myGUI.h` 
`page.cpp`&`page.h` 
`snake_main.cpp` 
## How to use it
* Download all files into your C++ compilation platform and run the prpject.
* If you choose `standalone mode`, use up-down-left-right direction keys to control your snake to move.
* If `two player mode` is chosen, the other snake's direction are controlled by W-S-A-D keys.
* For all snakes, you can click the `space` key to accelerate speed and click again to reset the original speed.
* Pay attention to all the rules shown in the beginning of each game.
* for more detailed information, you can check the `report.pdf`.
