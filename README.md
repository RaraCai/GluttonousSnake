# Gluttonous Snake Game
`notice`  This is one of Course Projects of my OOP course at school.  
It's welcome to exchange and discuss ideas but pay attention that `plagiarism` is NOT advocated if you are also learning the OOP course.
## File Schema
`Record.cpp`&`Record.h` the ranking page  
`item.cpp`&`item.h` the snake class, the food class, the wall class  
`manager.cpp`&`Record.h` the manager class to control the program  
`myGUI.cpp`&`myGUI.h` my personalized GUI style and related classed  
`page.cpp`&`page.h` the page class  
`snake_main.cpp` the main file
## How to use it

* If `two player mode` is chosen, the other snake's direction are controlled by W-S-A-D keys.

* For all snakes, you can click the `space` key to accelerate speed and click again to reset the original speed.
* You can check your history records and ranking in the `rank` page, but if you close the program, these records will be deleted.
